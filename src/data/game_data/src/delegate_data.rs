//! 'Delegates' are the core abstraction of the Riftcaller rules engine.
//!
//! There are two types of delegates: 'Events' and 'Queries'. Event delegates
//! allow cards to respond to specific events which occur during a game, such as
//! taking an action when a card is played or at the start of a turn.
//!
//! Query delegates allow cards to read & intercept requests for game data --
//! for example, the 'can play card' query is used to determine whether a card
//! can be legally played, a card delegate might add custom logic to determine
//! when it can be played. Similarly, the 'attack value' query is used to
//! determine the attack strength of a weapon; a delegate could intercept this
//! request to change the attack power of a given card.
//!
//! Every delegate in the game is run for every applicable event. Even when
//! cards are shuffled into a player's deck, their delegates are invoked. Each
//! delegate has a [RequirementFn] which needs to return true when the delegate
//! should run.
//!
//! Delegate callbacks are always raw function pointers, which means they
//! *cannot be closures* to state from their enclosing scope. When I last
//! profiled it, switching delegates to use Arc<dyn Fn()> closures resulted
//! in game simulation code running 25% slower.
//!
//! Delegate enum members automatically have an associated struct generated for
//! them by the [DelegateEnum] macro, which is the name of the enum variant with
//! the prefix `Event` or `Query`, e.g. [DawnEvent] for `Delegate::Dawn`.
//!
//! # Example Generated Code
//! We generate approximately the following code for each delegate enum value:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
//! pub struct OnDawnEvent(pub TurnNumber);
//!
//! impl EventData<TurnNumber> for OnDawnEvent {
//!     fn data(&self) -> TurnNumber {
//!         self.0
//!     }
//!
//!     fn extract(delegate: &Delegate) -> Option<EventDelegate<TurnNumber>> {
//!         match delegate {
//!             Delegate::OnDawn(d) => Some(*d),
//!             _ => None,
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
