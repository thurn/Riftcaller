/// A Flag is a variant of boolean which typically indicates whether some game
/// action can currently be taken. Flags have a 'default' state, which is the
/// value of the flag based on standard game rules, and an 'override' state,
/// which is a value set by specific delegates. An override of 'false' takes
/// precedence over an override of 'true'.
///
/// For example, the 'CanPlay' delegate will be invoked with
/// `Flag::Default(false)` if a card cannot currently be played according to the
/// standard game rules (sufficient mana available, correct player's turn, etc).
/// A delegate could transform this via `allow()` to allow the card
/// to be played. A second delegate could set `disallow()` to prevent
/// the card from being played, and this would take priority.
