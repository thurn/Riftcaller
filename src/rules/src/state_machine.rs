/// Implements a simple state machine pattern. State machines have associated
/// general data as well as named individual steps. A state machine
/// consists of a function which takes a requested step, applies its associated
/// game mutations, and then returns the next step to enter.
///
/// State machines are useful because:
///  1) They are interruptible. The state machine can pause while a user-facing
///     prompt is resolved.
///  2) They repeatedly query state. A simple mutation function tends to persist
///     information in local variables, but this can cause subtle errors if game
///     mutations are triggered which update those values. The state machine
///     ensures each step is run with an up-to-date snapshot of the game state.
///
/// State machines operate on a stack (last in, first out) basis. If a second
/// instance of a state machine is initiated, that instance runs to completion
/// before the first state machine is resumed.
