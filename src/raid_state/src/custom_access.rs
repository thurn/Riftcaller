/// Initiates a "Custom Access" raid.

/// A custom access raid is a raid that runs through the "access" phase for a
/// room on a given set of cards, which might be described in card text with
/// phrasing like "access the top 5 cards of the vault".
///
/// Custom access raids fire events and add history entries directly related to
/// scoring and accessing cards:
///
///  - CardAccessEvent
///  - ChampionScoreCardEvent
///  - ScoreCardEvent
///  - RazeCardEvent
///  - HistoryEvent::ScoreAccessedCard
///  - HistoryEvent::RazeAccessedCard
///
/// They do *not* fire events or add history entries related to overall raid
/// state, such as:
///
///  - RaidAccessStartEvent
///  - RaidAccessSelectedEvent
///  - RaidAccessEndEvent
///  - RaidSuccessEvent
///  - RaidEndEvent
///  - HistoryEvent::RaidSuccess
///
/// "CustomAccessEndEvent" is fired when a custom access is completed.
///
/// The game *is* considered to have an active raid with the given target during
/// a custom access and any "during a raid" conditions are considered true.
/// However, the raid does not count as a "room access" for effects like "if you
/// accessed the vault this turn".
