Configuration for integrating Play Asset Delivery with unity addressables.

- Scene Loading in unity currently freezes forever on Android App Bundle builds if you have too many assets (>500MB?)
- Unity provides sample code for this, but it is incredibly buggy and broken.
- They are allegedly going to release a new version eventually that actually works
- Their code does not create the right directory structure.
- Unity changes this in a minor release and didn't fix their samples.
- The bundles are supposed to go under src/main/assets in each pack
- See https://forum.unity.com/threads/pad-unity-2021-3-not-created-src-main-assets-automatically-for-custom-asset-bundle.1389945/#post-9131950
- Attempted to fix their code to create the expected directory structure
- Even with this fix, PlayAssetDeliveryAssetBundleProvider is doing something wrong with its async operations
- Attempting to load assets gives an error
- "Exception: The ProvideHandle is invalid. After the handle has been completed, it can no longer be used."
- Google provides their own Unity plugin which works directly with AssetBundles
- It might be easier to just roll something on top of Google's solution, maybe they're more competent than Unity
- Fast Follow asset packs have a maximum size of 512MB, need to split them up
- Install Time asset pack has a max size of 1024MB, currently at 1262MB, could probably get under that limit
- .AAB bundle uploads always get rejected unless you are targeting the latest android API version
- You need to put the keystore password from 1password into Unity every time you launch in order to build the bundle
- You need to increment the 'android build version code' in player settings every time you do a build
- Doing development with asset bundles set to "on demand" *does* work
- It's just "fast follow" that is broken wtih the invalid handle error
